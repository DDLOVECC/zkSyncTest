# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
Npx verify
```
npx hardhat verify --network zkTestnet 0xd65EbC838aa387c7CA2747f308E9854f
d1c4f220 "Hi there!"
```
